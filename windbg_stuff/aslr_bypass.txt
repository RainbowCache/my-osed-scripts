Win32 function SymGetSymFromName() can resolve memory addresses.
You can find this by examining the imports of an image from Ida.

If a service automatically restarts and the base address contains bad chars, crash the service!
You can check for automatic restart with Procmon. Filter: operation contains Process.

Finding the preferred base load address of a DLL in windbg:
0:077> dd libeay32IBM019 + 3c L1
031f003c  00000108
0:077> dd libeay32IBM019 + 108 + 34 L1
031f013c  10000000

Use this to calculate offsets for rop chains. <absolute address> - <preferred base address>.

Setting breakpoints example: bp libeay32IBM019+0x1fd8
